      "than what they pay will actually pay the IRS under the installment method?  I \n",

      "2) Does the balance sheet have to change a little?  For example, does \n",

      "calendar year outperform the broader markets at the\n",
      "beginning of the following year.   Typically, these stocks\n",

      "$50 - $750 million.  The January Effect tends to occur more\n",
      "often with small to mid-cap stocks than it does with\n",
      "large-cap stocks.  Utilizing the current ratio and\n",

      "balance sheet strength.  Companies with high current ratios\n",

      "rates.  Positive forecast earnings growth is then sought to\n",
