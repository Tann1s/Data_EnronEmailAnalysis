Hey, nice spreadsheet.  Two minor questions: 

1) Isn't the provision for taxes on the income statement actually the taxes 
on the 'income' they made from using the sales method (equal to 46%), rather 
than what they pay will actually pay the IRS under the installment method?  I 
think the notes show how instead of paying the 4.1$ based on their recognized 
income, they pay some itty bitty amount based on installment.  If so, I think 
they actually get a 46%  tax break on the 1 million and change that they lose 
using a cash basis.  Still a loss, just not so big.  Anyway, I'm not sure if 
I'm thinking straight on this, but that's how I read the numbers.

2) Does the balance sheet have to change a little?  For example, does 
shareholder equity change since the income that goes to retained earnings is 
now a loss, rather than a gain?  Also, if revenue is recognized on a cash 
basis and is now much smaller, there needs to be another liability to equal 
out the decrease in revenues with the still large notes receivables on the 
asset side (as you note in the answer the notes recievables stays the same).  
Seems like they might need a liability like "deferred profits" or some such 
thing, such that the ["deferred profits" +  revenues (recognized on cash 
basis)] = notes receivables.

Anyway, I may not have this right, but thought I'd bring it up to see what 
you think.

Best,
Jeff

Interoffice
Memorandum

Enron's performance has been exceptional.  This performance is reflected in 
our stock price, in the recognition we receive in the media and financial 
communities, and, most importantly, in the enthusiasm of our people.  It has 
been clear to us for some time that we are driving fundamental change in the 
marketplace and that our natural gas, electricity and communications networks 
can be positioned for even greater growth.  A &new economy8 is emerging, an 
economy based on intellectual capital and the compelling economics of 
networks.  Capturing the opportunities in this new economy calls for 
increased coordination and integration across our wholesale (ECT, ECM, EI), 
retail (EES), and communications (ECI) businesses.  It is our intention to 
combine the operations of these businesses into a cohesive organization that 
will ensure we realize the growth we foresee in all our businesses.

To this end, we are initiating a number of organization and staffing changes 
in these businesses and related changes in the Enron Office of the Chairman, 
in Corporate Staff groups, and in a number of management/personnel 
committees.  Other business units, EOG, GPG, PGE, and Azurix, will not be 
directly affected.  Accordingly, the following changes are effective 
immediately.

Enron Office of the Chairman

Joe Sutton will join the Office of the Chairman as Vice Chairman.  In his new 
role, Joe will work with the two of us to manage the operations of the 
company.  

Rebecca Mark, previously Vice Chairman of the company, will now fully 
concentrate on her responsibilities as Chairman and CEO of Azurix, our most 
recent public company. Rebecca has also been elected to the Enron Board of 
Directors, effective today.

Ken Harrison, previously Vice Chairman of the company, will fully concentrate 
on his responsibilities as Chairman and CEO of Portland General Electric and 
Non-Executive Chairman of Enron Communications.  Ken will continue to serve 
on Enron's Board of Directors.

Redefined Business Units

ECT, ECM, EI, EES, and ECI will be regrouped into eight regions/businesses 
and five global functions.  Each region/business will be operated as an 
independent entity but will coordinate staffing, career paths, compensation 
and performance review across all units.  Each global function will provide 
its specialized expertise across all regions/businesses.  Included in these 
functions is a new technology function, which will focus on information 
systems and growth of our e-commerce capabilities where we believe there is 
enormous potential.  These organizational units and their leadership are as 
follows:

 Regions/Businesses

 North America:  Cliff Baxter, CEO; Kevin Hannon, COO
 Europe:  Mark Frevert, CEO; John Sherriff, President; Dan McCarty, COO
 South America: Jim Bannantine, Co-CEO; Diomedes Christodoulou, Co-CEO
 India:  Sanjay Bhatnagar, CEO
 Caribbean, Middle East:  David Haug, CEO
 Asia, Africa:  Rebecca McDonald, CEO
 EES:  Lou Pai, CEO; Tom White, Vice Chairman
 ECI:  Joe Hirko, Co-CEO; Ken Rice, Co-CEO (Ken Harrison ) non-executive 
Chairman)




 Global Functions

 Risk Management:  Greg Whalley, CEO
 Finance:  Andy Fastow, CFO; Jeff McMahon, Treasurer
 Asset Operations:  Kurt Huneke, CEO
 EE&CC:  Larry Izzo, CEO
 Technology:  Mike McConnell, CEO

Corporate Staff

All corporate and EI staff units will be regrouped into six corporate staff 
groups.  These staff groups will support all operations of Enron.  These 
organizational units and their leadership are as follows:

 Legal:  Jim Derrick, EVP and General Counsel; Rob Walls, SVP and Deputy 
General Counsel
 Risk Assessment and Control:  Rick Buy, EVP
 Accounting and HR:  Rick Causey, EVP and Chief Accounting Officer
 Investor Relations:  Mark Koenig, EVP
 Other Staff Groups:  Steve Kean, EVP and Chief of Staff
 Corporate Development:  To be determined.

Committees

A new Executive Committee will be formed to replace the existing Management 
and Operating Committees.  Membership will be as follows:

 Ken Lay, Chairman
 Jeff Skilling, Alternate Chairman
 Joe Sutton
           Stan Horton
Jim Bannantine         Kurt Huneke
 Cliff Baxter         Larry Izzo
 Sanjay Bhatnagar        Steve Kean 
Rick Buy         Mark Koenig
 Rick Causey         Rebecca Mark (Ad hoc)
 Diomedes Christodoulou        Mike McConnell 
 Jim Derrick         Rebecca McDonald
 Andy Fastow         Jeff McMahon
 Peggy Fowler         Lou Pai
 Mark Frevert         Mark Papa (Ad hoc)
 Kevin Hannon         Ken Rice
 Ken Harrison         John Sherriff 
 David Haug         Greg Whalley
 Joe Hirko         Tom White
 

Four other committees, which will be essential to the success of this new 
organization, will be formed.  These committees are:

 Managing Director and SVP Personnel Committee:  Jeff Skilling, Chairman
 Vice President Personnel Committee:  Kevin Hannon, Chairman
 Vision and Values Committee: Joe Sutton, Chairman
 Workforce Diversity:  Ken Lay, Chairman

Details of membership on these committees will follow shortly.

Summary

Over the next several weeks all of the specifics of this reorganization will 
be further ironed out and communicated.  In the meantime, please bear with us 
-  we are confident that these changes will have a significant, positive 
impact on the operation and growth of the company.

Body:
ENA BA&R is currently in the process of preparing the 12/31/99 financial 
statements to be filed with the NYMEX by July 21st in order to keep our 
trading seat.  These financial statements reflect all of the North America 
trading operations.  ECTEG1 is ENA's legal rollup within Hyperion and should 
reflect all of the North American trading (i.e., price risk management) 
activity.  Therefore, Consolidated Reporting, with the assistance of Trading 
Accounting and Tax, prepared the financial statements with ECTEG1 activity.  
These financial statements are complete and ready for BA&R management review 
and reflect $722MM in earnings.

However, as of 6/29, we were notified by the Tax department that three 
companies were included in ECTEG1 as of 12/31/99 that were no longer legal 
owned by ENA.  In addition, there was one company that became ENA owned 
during 1999.  The companies are as follows:

Improperly Included:
ECM Treasury Consolidated  (Company 969)
ECT Retail Services    (Company 1Q6)
ECT Power Marketing, Inc. - Retail  (Company 890)

Improperly Excluded:
Enron Gas Liquids, Inc.    (Company 104)

I have corresponded with Tana Jones from the Legal department, Johnson Leo in 
Corporate Reporting, and Julie Gartner from the Tax department to determine if
the financial statements that we prepared reflected accurate and complete 
North America trading activity.  These discussions confirmed that the 
Hyperion legal 
structure was not accurately reflecting ENA's actual legal ownership.  In 
addition, the three companies have $192MM in trading activity income that 
would be
removed from the bottom line.  This activity should probably be reported to 
the NYMEX (regardless of legal structure) as it represents price risk 
management
activity.

The primary issue is accuracy of the financial statements.  We are prepared 
to have to restate the compiled financials as soon as we are notified where
we can retrieve accurate ledger information.  The other main issue is 
timing.  We need to file these financial statements no later than July 21st.  
Before that can
happen they need to be reviewed by several levels of management in several 
departments.

The Legal department is currently reviewing the NYMEX requirements in order 
to determine the proper activity to report.  As soon as that is determined, 
we can
proceed with data retrieval.

Please contact me if have any questions, concerns or comments.

Wall Street City,s Stock Search of the Week

1.  Searching for January Effect Hopefuls

The "January Effect" is an oft-discussed phenomenon that
occurs when stocks that have sold off near the end of one
calendar year outperform the broader markets at the
beginning of the following year.   Typically, these stocks
decline late in the calendar year due to tax selling, but
are repurchased after the wash sale period expires.
Candidates for an early calendar year rebound are often those
stocks with favorable fundamental characteristics.

January Effect Hopefuls is a search strategy that screens
for such candidates.  Primary criteria include a negative
26-week return and a market capitalization of between
$50 - $750 million.  The January Effect tends to occur more
often with small to mid-cap stocks than it does with
large-cap stocks.  Utilizing the current ratio and
debt-to-equity criteria in the restrictive mode screens for
balance sheet strength.  Companies with high current ratios
and low debt-to-equity ratios have lower levels of financial
risk.  The two revenue percentage change criteria screen for
companies with acceleration in their quarterly revenue growth
rates.  Positive forecast earnings growth is then sought to
improve the chances that the companies will continue their
growth trends in the future.  As a final criterion, positive
earnings surprises are sought for the past four reported
quarters; companies that have a history of exceeding analysts'
expectations tend to outperform their peers.

Though the search strategy is designed with the January
Effect in mind, it works well throughout the year for
investors who follow contrarian strategies.  Investors who
are eyeing the results with the January Effect in mind should
note that back testing showed material divergences in
individual stock returns, therefore, selecting a basket of
securities instead of one or two stocks may reduce risk.

3.  One January Effect Hopeful

Shares of Globespan {GSPN} declined by 70 percent during
October and November.  The decline was caused by the mass
exodus out of tech stocks, profit warnings from Lucent {LU}
- a major customer - and comments out of Cisco {CSCO} - also
a customer - that it would be reducing inventory.  Despite
these market events, GSPN has not issued a profit warning
and Bloomberg News Services is reporting that an analyst
with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is predicting that GSPN will
meet revenue forecasts in 2001.  Though GPSN, a developer of
DSL integrated circuits, continues to trade a P/E ratio
untypical of many January effect candidates, the extent of
the decline could be more than enough to buffer the stock
from a potential earnings warning, creating the possiblity
of a bounce in 2001.

Fundamentals Always Prevail: These 14 Stocks Will  Prove It
Since 1994, Alvin Toral averaged a whopping +79.3% yearly. His  secret?

Get  this FREE Report:
http://www.investools.com/c/go/PFUN/WHISP-pfunTB1?s=S601  


Despite an onslaught of earnings warnings from tech  companies lately, the 
consensus expectation for Oracle (ORCL) is for  at least a penny earnings 
surprise and possibly a two-cent positive  surprise.

Bert Hochfeld at Josephthal & Co., one of the more accurate  analysts 
following Oracle, is one of two analysts that have an official earnings  
estimate of $0.11 per share. Mr. Hochfeld told clients recently that the 
company  would meet his expectations with strong U.S. sales offset by 
disappointing  European sales.?

The consensus among the 28 analysts is for Oracle  to earn $0.10 per share on 
revenue of just under $2.7 billion, yet even the more  conservative analysts 
are optimistic. Gretchen Teagarden at Salomon Smith Barney  is one of the few 
analysts with an estimate below $0.10 per share, but her  revenue estimate is 
slightly above the consensus revenue estimate.

On  Tuesday Chris Shilakes at Merrill Lynch told clients that he is 
projecting  earnings of $0.10 per share on revenue of $2.68 billion. However, 
he added that  revenue might be slightly better than his projections and 
Oracle's continued  improvement with operating margins should lead to 
earnings of $0.11 to $0.12 per  share.?

Last week Jim Pickrel at Chase H & Q told clients that  he expects the 
company to meet or beat his earnings estimate of $0.10 per share  and revenue 
estimate of $2.6 billion. He stated that Oracle's "pipeline appears  robust" 
and that the company should achieve 52% revenue growth or better in its  
applications business.

The pressing issues regarding Oracle among the  analysts are next quarter and 
the recent management turnover. Mr. Pickrel stated  Oracle's Senior Vice 
President Gary Bloom's departure would not have much of an  impact, but 
turnover in other key management positions is an issue. Yet, the  recent pact 
with CitiGroup (C) adds some  confidence in the current team. Richard Davis 
at Needham & Co. told clients  recently that this quarter would be fine but 
still downgraded Oracle's stock  because of the departure of Bloom and Senior 
Vice President Ray Lane reduces the  company's earnings visibility and may 
encourage others to leave the company as  well.

Mr. Upin said that Oracle could have a tough February quarter and  could see 
its toughest test of its performance in the applications space in the  May 
quarter. Yet, overall the analysts like the stock and believe the recent  
stock price is a buying opportunity.?

As result, the company will  need to at least meet or beat the $0.11 Earnings 
Whisper number and provide the  analysts comfort with the current management 
team and the upcoming quarters. If  this can be accomplished during the 
conference call on Thursday, some analysts  believe the stock could reach $35 
in the very near term. You may listen to  Oracle's conference call at 
http://www.nasdaq.com/reference/broadcast_oracle.htm  beginning at 5:30 PM ET 
on Thursday.

Hi Jeff,

I guess you would make a better accountant than me.  Your analysis sounds
right.  Feel free to make changes as fit.

My apologies for missing out on these items.

Body:
This is a follow-up on our efforts to identify potential write-offs in 2000 
to utilize the possible availability of non-recurring earnings at the 
Corporate level.  Attached are spreadsheets for the 2nd quarter noteholders 
reports balance sheets, including detailed breakdowns of balance sheet 
items.  We reviewed these schedules for possible additional write-off 
candidates.  This review confirmed that the big items had already been 
identified (reg assets and south-end impairment reserve).  However, reviewing 
the spreadsheets reminded us that we have DOT safety user fees due in 
December (~$1.1MM) and a $1.5MM annual payment to Mobil due by 1/1/2001.  
While both of these items would more appropriately be charged to expense in 
2001, we could probably accelerate them into 2000 without too much visibility.

Subject: ESA ORGANIZATIONAL ANNOUNCEMENT

Interoffice Memorandum 

To:	All ESA Employees		
			
From:	James Bannantine
	Diomedes Christodoulou		
			
			
Subject:	ESA ORGANIZATIONAL ANNOUNCEMENT	    Date:  January 24, 2000	


1999 was a great year for Enron South America.  In addition to consolidating 
our unique position in the region and despite the economic upheaval from the 
currency devaluation in Brazil, we were able to generate significant net 
income and position ESA as an important business unit for Enron. Moreover, 
1999 was a great year for Enron as a whole. The success of the strategy to 
rely increasingly on intellectual capital is reflected in the recent rise in 
our stock price.


To keep the momentum going in our region we must now steer the business 
toward the creation of a regional merchant platform.  To facilitate this goal 
we have decided to reorganize  by customer type.  Below are the highlights of 
the new structure, which will consist of five major P/L centers:


The Wholesale Merchant Unit will be responsible for gas and power marketing 
and supply at the wholesale level. This team will also handle asset 
development projects, financial products and all other deals involving 
wholesale suppliers and customers.  Brett Wiggs will lead the Wholesale 
Merchant Unit.


The Direct Sales Unit will focus on developing the industrial market.  A key 
objective will be to expand our role from that of an energy supplier at the 
user gate to a broader role inside the fence and become a total energy 
manager for the industrial customer through outsourcing with Enron.  Don 
Black will lead the Direct Sales effort. 

Our asset platform will be reorganized into three major units to include:  
(a) Generation and  Pipeline Assets,  to be led by Peter Weidler; (b) Gas 
Distribution Assets, which will continue to manage all our gas distribution 
companies, to be led by Rick Waddell, and  (c) Electricity Distribution 
Assets (Elektro), which will continue to be operated under the leadership of 
Orlando Gonzalez.  All our assets will be organized internally to reflect our 
merchant strategy. 


In addition, we will continue to have the existing support functions with 
some minor modifications.


The M&A function will be expanded to include capital management of our assets 
and will become part of the Regional Finance Unit headed by Joe Kishkill. The 
Regional Finance Unit will also include funding, accounting, treasury, 
information systems and communications.


The Risk Management function will also be expanded and will include 
structuring, modeling and pricing.   This function will support the 
activities of all the P/L centers.  We are currently actively recruiting 
internally for this position. 


Legal, Regulatory and Government Affairs, and Human Resources/Administration 
will continue to be under the leadership of Randy Young, Jos, Bestard and 
Miguel Padron respectively.  We are also actively recruiting for the head of 
Public Relations for the region.


The Executive Committee of ESA will be represented by all the above mentioned 
individuals.  A copy of the organizational chart reflecting these changes is 
included.  Further communications will be sent to all ESA employees as we 
complete the organizational process.

To all

Tim has delivered the initial microsoft project plan for the MO integration - 
this is available to all via the integration project 'office' - i.e. Richard 
and Phil.

I summarise the key themes as :-

summary operational risk assessment across all MG entities and functional 
groups ( as defined within the DPR )
defining MO organisational structure and fit with Enron's control model - 
particularly logistics and co-ordination
interaction with Fin Ops processes
month end consolidation process
SAP implementation
working capital and revenue forecasting
interaction with RAC re VAR / trading limits ( market and credit )
awaiting notice of trading limits
credit counterparty review and set up within GCP
VAR methodology implementation
interaction with IT re systems development/maintenance
AS 400 development timetable and roll out to NY for WANG replacement
MITS/EOL migration
Use of Enlighten in application architecture
defined IT resource requirement
interaction with Legal re Enron Metals name change and related documentation 
issues
MO integration planning for settlements and trade accounting

The focus and objectives relating to the above for this week are as follows :-

review of London processes and define boundaries for segregation of duties 
implementation ( Action TPP ) - also discuss extension to NY ( SWilson )
review of Wolff activities in Germany ( Action KR/AC )
continuing review of new recycling yards ( project Cook ) in Germany ( Action 
AH/RJ )
review interdependencies between MO/Fin Ops/RAC/Systems integration plans ( 
Action MJ/RS )
document current assessment of operational risk with particular emphasis on 
Wolff and Recycling businesses ( Action MJ with KR/AC/AH/RJ/TPP/SW )
Brainstorm month end accounting close and potential earnings election for 
consolidation ( Action  TPP/MJ/BA/SWood )

Mike,

Attached is the "Net Works" section we discussed.  In addition, could you ask 
the Online team for the missing information in this Jeff Skilling earnings 
release quote.  We need to distribute the earnings release draft early this 
afternoon.

 "In the second quarter, EnronOnline registered a ______% increase in volumes 
and a _____% increase in transactions versus the first quarter."

Thanks,
Mark
