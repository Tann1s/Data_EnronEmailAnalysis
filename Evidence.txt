Body:
ENA BA&R is currently in the process of preparing the 12/31/99 financial 
statements to be filed with the NYMEX by July 21st in order to keep our 
trading seat.  These financial statements reflect all of the North America 
trading operations.  ECTEG1 is ENA's legal rollup within Hyperion and should 
reflect all of the North American trading (i.e., price risk management) 
activity.  Therefore, Consolidated Reporting, with the assistance of Trading 
Accounting and Tax, prepared the financial statements with ECTEG1 activity.  
These financial statements are complete and ready for BA&R management review 
and reflect $722MM in earnings.

However, as of 6/29, we were notified by the Tax department that three 
companies were included in ECTEG1 as of 12/31/99 that were no longer legal 
owned by ENA.  In addition, there was one company that became ENA owned 
during 1999.  The companies are as follows:

Improperly Included:
ECM Treasury Consolidated  (Company 969)
ECT Retail Services    (Company 1Q6)
ECT Power Marketing, Inc. - Retail  (Company 890)

Improperly Excluded:
Enron Gas Liquids, Inc.    (Company 104)

I have corresponded with Tana Jones from the Legal department, Johnson Leo in 
Corporate Reporting, and Julie Gartner from the Tax department to determine if
the financial statements that we prepared reflected accurate and complete 
North America trading activity.  These discussions confirmed that the 
Hyperion legal 
structure was not accurately reflecting ENA's actual legal ownership.  In 
addition, the three companies have $192MM in trading activity income that 
would be
removed from the bottom line.  This activity should probably be reported to 
the NYMEX (regardless of legal structure) as it represents price risk 
management
activity.

The primary issue is accuracy of the financial statements.  We are prepared 
to have to restate the compiled financials as soon as we are notified where
we can retrieve accurate ledger information.  The other main issue is 
timing.  We need to file these financial statements no later than July 21st.  
Before that can
happen they need to be reviewed by several levels of management in several 
departments.

The Legal department is currently reviewing the NYMEX requirements in order 
to determine the proper activity to report.  As soon as that is determined, 
we can
proceed with data retrieval.

Please contact me if have any questions, concerns or comments.

### EVIDENCE 2

The email delves into adjusting accounting methods and balance sheet entries to reflect desired financial outcomes.
Here's why:
Revenue Recognition Methods: Shifting between accounting methods can be a method to manipulate earnings and tax liabilities.
Deferred Profits/Liabilities: Introducing or adjusting liabilities to offset changes in revenue recognition can obscure the true financial position

Hey, nice spreadsheet.  Two minor questions: 

1) Isn't the provision for taxes on the income statement actually the taxes 
on the 'income' they made from using the sales method (equal to 46%), rather 
than what they pay will actually pay the IRS under the installment method?  I 
think the notes show how instead of paying the 4.1$ based on their recognized 
income, they pay some itty bitty amount based on installment.  If so, I think 
they actually get a 46%  tax break on the 1 million and change that they lose 
using a cash basis.  Still a loss, just not so big.  Anyway, I'm not sure if 
I'm thinking straight on this, but that's how I read the numbers.

2) Does the balance sheet have to change a little?  For example, does 
shareholder equity change since the income that goes to retained earnings is 
now a loss, rather than a gain?  Also, if revenue is recognized on a cash 
basis and is now much smaller, there needs to be another liability to equal 
out the decrease in revenues with the still large notes receivables on the 
asset side (as you note in the answer the notes recievables stays the same).  
Seems like they might need a liability like "deferred profits" or some such 
thing, such that the ["deferred profits" +  revenues (recognized on cash 
basis)] = notes receivables.

Anyway, I may not have this right, but thought I'd bring it up to see what 
you think.

Best,
Jeff


###  EVIDENCE 3
The strategy to accelerate expenses to a prior fiscal year to utilize non-recurring earnings directly points to financial manipulation aimed at enhancing reported earnings and obscuring true financial obligations.
Here's why:
Identifying Write-offs:
Non-Recurring Earnings Utilization: The email mentions identifying potential write-offs to leverage non-recurring earnings at the corporate level.
Accelerating Expenses:
Timing Adjustments: Suggesting the acceleration of certain expenses (e.g., DOT safety user fees and payments to Mobil) from 2001 to 2000 to manipulate financial visibility.
Visibility Minimization: By moving expenses to a different fiscal year, the intent is likely to present a healthier financial state for 2000.

Body:
This is a follow-up on our efforts to identify potential write-offs in 2000 
to utilize the possible availability of non-recurring earnings at the 
Corporate level.  Attached are spreadsheets for the 2nd quarter noteholders 
reports balance sheets, including detailed breakdowns of balance sheet 
items.  We reviewed these schedules for possible additional write-off 
candidates.  This review confirmed that the big items had already been 
identified (reg assets and south-end impairment reserve).  However, reviewing 
the spreadsheets reminded us that we have DOT safety user fees due in 
December (~$1.1MM) and a $1.5MM annual payment to Mobil due by 1/1/2001.  
While both of these items would more appropriately be charged to expense in 
2001, we could probably accelerate them into 2000 without too much visibility.

###  EVIDENCE 4
Adjusting the language around accounting and earnings reporting suggests efforts to present financial information in a specific light, potentially obscuring unfavorable details or presenting earnings more favorably.
Here's why:
Language Changes: The email discusses modifying the language in a memo related to accounting issues and earnings reporting.
Coordination with Accounting Officer: Mentions coordination with Rick Causey, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, indicating internal adjustments to financial reporting.
